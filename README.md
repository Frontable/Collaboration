The task involves finding the longest working pairs of employees per projects.
Algorithm Overview

CSV Parsing:
  Read the CSV file and parse employee data, considering multiple date formats and handling NULL end dates.

Date Parsing:
  Implement a flexible date parsing mechanism using SimpleDateFormat and DateTimeFormatter to accommodate different date formats.

Pair Identification:
  Iterate through the list of employees and identify pairs who have worked on the same project.
  Calculate the duration of their collaboration, considering start and end dates.

Longest Working Pairs:
  Keep track of the longest working pairs for each project using a HashMap.
   If a new pair exceeds the duration of an existing pair, update the record in the HashMap.
